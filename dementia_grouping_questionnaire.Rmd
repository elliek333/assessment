# Introduction
This smaller script has two components: a shiny questionnaire and a LDA model which predicts dementia grouping based on determinants. These are then combined when the responses to the shiny questionnaire are used by the model to predict dementia group. It is recommended that [main.Rmd](./main.Rmd) is looked at first. The model is not perfect, dementia is a complex disease. As such this tool is not meant for diagnosis.

Work flow is produced with R, a statistical computing language, [@r-core-team] and R Markdown which generates this report.[@rmarkdown]. The **`bookdown`** package is used to add features to R Markdown such as cross referencing [@bookdown].

# Data Import and Transformation: dementia_model: Used In Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

visit_data and patient_data are imported using R, the **`tidyverse`** [@tidyverse] and **`readxl`** [@readxl] packages.

As with the data sets in [main.Rmd](./main.Rmd), dementia_model starts by merging visit_data and patient_data into one set by subject ID. Post import and merging, data variable names are cleaned with the **`janitor`** [@janitor] package. Subject_id, cdr, mri_number and visit columns are removed as these give no information that could be for the LDA. NA rows are also removed. The values in m_f have been converted to numerical values for the LDA (F = 1, M = 2). Anyone with a cdr of 0.0 was treated as nondemented while anything higher was treated as demented. This is to create a model that makes a binary choice between dementia or not.
```{r import}
# reading in both xlsx sheets from the dementia.xlsx file
visit_data <- read_excel("data_raw/dementia.xlsx", sheet = 1)
patient_data <-read_excel("data_raw/dementia.xlsx", sheet = 2)
```

```{r transformation-model-dataset}
# creating a dataset that will be used in the LDA

# key difference is swapping cdr for group. This is a simple model that tries to predict whether a person has dementia, not the severity.

# merging data frames (by subject_id) and cleaning column names
dementia_model <- merge.data.frame(visit_data, patient_data,
  by = "Subject ID") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names()

# removing columns not used for LDA, rows with missing values and duplicate rows
dementia_model <- subset(dementia_model, 
                         select =- c(group, subject_id, mri_number, visit)) %>% 
  drop_na() 

# converting categorical data (F or M) to numerical data (F = 1, M = 2) for use in LDA
dementia_model[dementia_model == "F"] <- 1 
dementia_model[dementia_model == "M"] <- 2
dementia_model$m_f <- as.numeric(dementia_model$m_f)

# changing all converted with a cdr of 0.5 or above to demented
# changing all converted with a cdr of 0.0 to non demented
dementia_model <- dementia_model %>% mutate(cdr = replace(cdr, cdr == 0.0, "Nondemented"))
dementia_model <- dementia_model %>% mutate(cdr = replace(cdr, cdr == 0.5, "Demented"))
dementia_model <- dementia_model %>% mutate(cdr = replace(cdr, cdr == 1, "Demented"))
dementia_model <- dementia_model %>% mutate(cdr = replace(cdr, cdr == 2, "Demented"))
```

# Shiny Questionaire
This questionnaire requires both personal information and data from T1 weighted MRI scans. It is not a diagnostic tool, its use is for identifying at risk individuals. Questionnaire is generated using **`shiny`** [@shiny] and **`shinyforms`** [@shinyforms].
```{r shiny-questionnaire, echo=FALSE}
questions <- list(
    list(id = "age", type = "numeric", title = "Age (Years)", mandatory = TRUE),
    list(id = "mmse", type = "numeric", title = "Patient MMSE Score", mandatory = TRUE,
         hint = "Type between 0 and 30"),
    list(id = "e_tiv", type = "numeric", title = "Patient eTIV Result [mm3]", mandatory = TRUE,
         hint = "for example: 1234"),
    list(id = "n_wbv", type = "numeric", title = "Patient nWBV Result [%]", mandatory = TRUE,
         hint = "For example: 0.678"),
    list(id = "asf", type = "numeric", title = "Patient ASF Result", mandatory = TRUE,
         hint = "For example: 1.234"),
    list(id = "m_f", type = "numeric", title = "Patient Sex", mandatory = TRUE,
         hint = "Type 1 For Female, 2 For Male"),
    list(id = "educ", type = "numeric", title = "Patient Years Spent In Education", mandatory = TRUE),
    list(id = "ses", type = "numeric", title = "Patient Hollingshead Four 
         Factor Index Of Social Status", mandatory = TRUE,
         hint = "Type between 1 and 5")
    
)

formInfo <- list(
    id = "basicinfo",
    questions = questions,
    storage = list(
        type = STORAGE_TYPES$FLATFILE,
        path = "responses"
    ),
    name = "Dementia Prediction Questionnaire",
    multiple = FALSE,
    validations = list(
        list(condition = "input$m_f <= 2",
             message = "Sex must be submitted as either 1 (female) or 2 (male)"),
        list(condition = "input$mmse <= 30",
             message = "MMSE scores range from 0 to 30"),
        list(condition = "input$ses <= 5",
             message = "Hollingshead four factor index of social status scores must
             range from 1-5"))
)

ui <- fluidPage(
    formUI(formInfo)
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
    formServer(formInfo)
  
}

shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)

# Dementia Grouping Prediction Model
Sub-setting of dementia_model into the testing and training data sets used in the LDA is realized with the **`caret`** package [@caret]. The **`MASS`** package [@mass] is used for the **`lda`** function.

Understanding The Confusion Matrix:
A confusion matrix is a way of evaluating model performance. Accuracy is total samples identified correctly. Mcnemar's Test P-Value is model significance based on 2x2 contingency table. Contingency table interpretation is shown in below:
