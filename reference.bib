  abstract = "Although it is generally held that about 10\% of the population
              is left-handed, reported figures vary widely due to differences
              in handedness classification criteria and subject
              characteristics. Among those population studies that have used
              the same handedness classification criteria, a consistent
              relationship between increasing right-hand preference and
              increasing age has been reported. One recent study of Alzheimer's
              disease (AD) reported a higher incidence of left-handedness in
              early onset relative to late onset cases. In the present study we
              examined handedness patterns in three elderly groups; normal (N =
              217), depression (N = 73), and AD (N = 114). Our results
              indicated a reduced frequency of left handedness in AD (2.6\%)
              relative to control (11.1\%) and depression (13.7\%) groups.
              Within the limited age range we studied (60-80 years), no
              relationships were found between age and handedness preference
              either within or across the groups. Furthermore, for the AD group
              there was no relationship between severity of global impairment
              and strength of handedness. Our results suggest that compared to
              right handers, left handers are less vulnerable to the cognitive
              changes associated with AD. Nevertheless it is also possible that
              left handers are overrepresented among early onset dementia
              patients and die before entering the pool of senile dementia
              patients. Further work is required to determine if early and late
              onset AD are associated with different incidences of left
              handedness.",

  abstract = "Purpose/Aim of the study: Research has suggested decreasing
              proportions of non-right handers in older age groups and reduced
              incidence of non-right handedness among individuals with
              Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that healthy elderly
              individuals would have a higher proportion of non-right handers
              than individuals with AD and that the proportion of non-right
              handers would decrease with increasing age. Further, we
              investigated whether the proportions of non-right handers
              differed between those with early and late onset of AD.Materials
              and Methods: Two-hundred and fifty-six healthy elderly and 182
              individuals with AD served as participants. Hand dominance was
              recorded based on side of writing during testing and self-report.
              We analyzed proportions of right handers and non-right handers
              for three age ranges ($\leq$ 69, 70 - 79, and $\geq$ 80 years). A
              second analysis focused on the proportions of right and non-right
              handers among patients with AD classified as either early or late
              disease onset.Results: Handedness proportions did not differ
              between the controls and ADs. For AD but not for controls, there
              was a trend towards reduced proportions of non-right handers with
              increasing age. Early onset AD was associated with a larger
              proportion of non-right handers compared to those with late onset
              AD.Conclusions: Results did not support a trend of decreasing
              non-right handedness with increasing age in controls, but did
              provide support for such a trend in individuals with AD. The
              results provided support for the hypothesis of increased
              incidence of non-right handedness in early onset vs. late onset
              AD.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To carry out a meta-analysis of the age-specific
              incidence of all dementias, including AD and vascular dementia.
              BACKGROUND: Several meta-analyses have been carried out on
              dementia prevalence, but none on its incidence. METHODS: We used
              loess-curve fitting to analyze data from 23 published studies
              reporting age-specific incidence data. RESULTS: The incidence of
              both dementia and AD rose exponentially up to the age of 90
              years, with no sign of leveling off. The incidence rates for
              vascular dementia varied greatly from study to study, but the
              trend was also for an exponential rise with age. There was no sex
              difference in dementia incidence (p = 0.21), but women tended to
              have a higher incidence of AD in very old age, and men tended to
              have a higher incidence of vascular dementia at younger ages.
              East Asian countries had a lower incidence of dementia than
              Europe (p = 0.0004), and also tended to have a lower incidence of
              AD. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of dementia rises exponentially to
              the age of 90 years. Any sex differences are small, and incidence
              is lower in East Asia than in Europe.",

  abstract = "An estimated 47 million people worldwide are living with dementia
              in 2015, and this number is projected to triple by 2050. In the
              absence of a disease-modifying treatment or cure, reducing the
              risk of developing dementia takes on added importance. In 2014,
              the World Dementia Council (WDC) requested the Alzheimer's
              Association evaluate and report on the state of the evidence on
              modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia. This
              report is a summary of the Association's evaluation, which was
              presented at the October 2014 WDC meeting. The Association
              believes there is sufficient evidence to support the link between
              several modifiable risk factors and a reduced risk for cognitive
              decline, and sufficient evidence to suggest that some modifiable
              risk factors may be associated with reduced risk of dementia.
              Specifically, the Association believes there is sufficiently
              strong evidence, from a population-based perspective, to conclude
              that regular physical activity and management of cardiovascular
              risk factors (diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension)
              reduce the risk of cognitive decline and may reduce the risk of
              dementia. The Association also believes there is sufficiently
              strong evidence to conclude that a healthy diet and lifelong
              learning/cognitive training may also reduce the risk of cognitive
              decline.",
